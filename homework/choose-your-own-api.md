## Objectives

- Reinforce component architecture in React
- Reinforce reading of API documentation (some are great, and some are terrible)
- Creating and designing your own features for a web app

## Requirements

We're going to build a front end for an API of your choice. Choose one from [this list](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)

_NOTE_ You'll need to choose one with `Auth` being `No` or `apiKey` since we haven't covered `OAuth` authentication yet.

_NOTE_ You'll also need to check to see if the API will work from your browser. You can do a quick check by making a small `create-react-app`, doing an `axios.get` or `fetch` of one API URL and see if you get browser errors.
