In this lecture, the primary focus is working more with state

## Learning Objectives

## Slides

## Full Code Samples

- [One-list](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/cohort-xiii/tree/master/week-05/two-list)

## Lecture notes

- Start off by reviewing what they know of state,
- build One-list, an API driven todo list
- if the students feel good, do 'pop-corn' coding where a student live codes on the projector
- start off with minimal design
- build the HTML, caution about pre-refactoring into components too fast
- style it like 80% with CSS
- start creating it and debug/code in real time
- this is more about answering questions and seeing React & state in action rather then building a working, complete todo list
