# Memory game

In this lecture,we will push the bounds of basic react state by creating a memory game. This key to this lecture to work with passing functions down to the children that affect the parent state.

This should be a two day lecture, with the minesweeper homework. Use this a vechile to answer questions about minesweeper.

## Learning Objectives

- passing state around using props and closures
- more state practice

## Recommended Previous Knowledge

- working with state
- components life cycle

## Slides

- None

## Lecture notes

- this lecture you will build a memory game
- for this, work with components and embrace the idea of components and reuses
- take your time, this should take 2 lectures
- use this as time to answers questions about minesweeper and to set up the students to succeed in minesweeper

## Assignments

- minesweeper
